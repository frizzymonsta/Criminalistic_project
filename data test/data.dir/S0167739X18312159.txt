Abstract: Although various researches have demonstrated that Social Networks offer a great opportunity to detect and manage emergencies and disasters in real life applications, in this paper we will show how the use of Multimedia Big Data extracted from modern On-Line Social Nets may enhance both the real time detection and the alerts diffusion in a well defined geographic area. In particular, we propose a Multimedia Big Data system that use both an incremental clustering event detection approach enriched with the analysis of multimedia content and a bio-inspired influence analysis technique, to support alert spread over a social network. Experiments are carried out on a real case study.
